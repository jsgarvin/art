    <p>Within the description on the back of each limited edition print,
       in close proximity to the serial number, I add a unique
       mark of acrylic paint.</p>

    <p>After allowing it time to dry, I take a high resolution macro photograph
       of the mark and include the photo with the details of the print in the
       online git repository as a permanent record associating that serial
       number with that unique mark of paint.</p>

    <p>It is my intent to make these marks nearly impossible to copy
       and reproduce. The photos are of high enough resolution that microscopic
       details in how the pigment attached to the paper, and even the cotton
       fibers in the paper itself, are readily visible.</p>
    
    <p>Feel free to click on the sample on the right, and then zoom in.</p>

    <p>As long as they properly verify the source of the photo of the mark, any
       qualified art authenticity expert should be able to use a strong
       magnifying glass or microscope and compare the image to the actual mark
       and confirm with relative ease that they are identical, or that the 
       print is a forgery.</p>

    <p>I believe that creating a sufficiently perfect replica of the pigment
       mark purely by hand would be impossible for even the most skilled
       counterfeiter. One might optimistically argue that eventually 3D
       printers may achieve the resolution necessary to accomplish the task.
       I highly doubt that, but authenticators can also check the positions of
       the cotton fibers in the paper itself.<p>
