    <p>Within the description on the back of each limited edition print,
       in close proximity to the serial number, I add a unique
       mark of acrylic paint.</p>

    <p>After allowing it time to dry, I take a high resolution macro photograph
       (actually, multiple focus stacked photographs) of the mark and include
       the photo with the details of the print in the online git repository
       as a permanent record associating that serial number with that unique
       mark of paint.</p>

    <p>It is my intent to make these marks as difficult as possible to copy
       and reproduce. The photos are of high enough resolution that microscopic
       details in how the pigment attached to the paper, and even the cotton
       fibers in the paper itself, are readily visible.</p>
    
    <p>Feel free to click on the sample on the right, and then zoom in.</p>

    <p>As long as they properly verify the source of the photo of the mark, any
       qualified art authenticity expert should be able to use a strong
       magnifying glass or microscope and compare the image to the actual mark
       and confirm with relative ease that they are identical, or that the 
       print is a forgery.</p>

    <p>I believe that creating a sufficiently perfect replica of the pigment
       mark purely by hand would be impossible for even the most skilled
       counterfieter. One might argue that eventually 3D printers may achieve
       the resolution necessary to accoplish the task. For that reason, 
       authenticators should also observe the cotton fibers in the paper
       itself. Even if the technology ever exists to create cotton paper with
       the fibers laid so perfectly to mimic what's in the photo, I suspect
       it would be too cost prohibitive to be of any use to a prospective
       counterfeiter.<p>
