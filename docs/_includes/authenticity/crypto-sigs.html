    <p>For each of my limited edition prints, I create a description of the print,
       including the title, year, size, serial number, materials used, etc. I then
       sign that description with my private key and include the full description
       and signature on the back of the print, in both a plain text human readable
       form, and in a machine readable (i.e. your smart phone) QR code. Since each
       print description contains information that is 100% unique to that specific
       print (i.e. the serial number), the signature on each print is also 100%
       unique to that print.<p> 

       <p>My public key is
       <a href='http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xD2DEC6AA316B5CDD'>
       published for the world</a> on major public keys servers 
       (fingerprint: ED97 F43E 1D86 6D62 31BB  04AD D2DE C6AA 316B 5CDD).
       Any cryptography expert, and most cryptography hobbyists, should be capable
       of taking my public key, and the QR code on the back of any of my prints, 
       and verifying that the signature matches.</p>

    <div class='large-12 columns'><h3>Wait.. what?</h3></div>

    <p>It is beyond the scope of this article to explain the concept
       of cryptographic signatures in depth, but I'll provide links
       at the end to futher reading and tools for those that are interested.</p>

    <p>For a grossly oversimplified analogy though, imagine a good old fashioned wax
       seal. In the Middle Ages, aristocrates used wax seals to, among other things,
       authenticate documents that they were signing. Everybody knew what Count
       Geoffrey's seal looked like, so when you saw a document with his seal, you
       could be reasonbly sure that Geoffery had signed it.</p>

    <p>Cryptographic signatures work similarily, except through the power of
       math and prime numbers. Wait! Stay with me, I'll try to keep this short.</p>

    <p>In this case, the stamp (the thing you press into the wax) is a pair of
       really, really, really, big prime numbers. This pair of numbers is called
       the "private key." Count Geoffery randomly selects a pair of huge prime
       numbers, and then he keeps these prime numbers (his private key) very, very
       secret.</p>

    <p>To sign (or stamp) a piece of text, Geoffery runs the text, and his private
       key (the prime numbers),
       through a specially crafted mathematical algorithm, and it spits out a
       long stream of what appears to be random letters, numbers and other symbols,
       which is called the "signature".
       It's not at all random though, and as crazy as this sounds, only that text,
       and those prime numbers can produce that particular signature.</p>

    <p>In our analogy, that stream of characters (the signature) represents the wax,
       stamped with Count Geoffery's stamp, on the back of a letter, and allowed to
       harden.  Anybody that receives that text, with that signature, can verify,
       with mathematically certainty, that Count Geoffery signed it.</p>

    <p>"But how?" you ask. Well, in addition to Count Geoffery's private key (the
        two prime numbers), he also has what's called a "public key", which is
        simply the two prime numbers multiplied together. Imagine if Geoffery's
        private key was the prime numbers 17 and 47 (these aren't nearly long
        enough in reality, but bear with me). Geoffery's public key then would
        be 17 x 47, or 799.</p>

    <p>There's no known way to figure out what two prime numbers were multiplied
       together to get 799, other than just trying all of the possibilities, which
       is why, other than for simplified explanations like this, Count Geoffery
       would want really, really, really big prime numbers. So, Count Geoffery
       can safely broadcast his public key (799) to the whole world and know that
       his private key (17 and 47) is safe and secure.</p>

    <p>Finally, to verify that a letter of admiration, claiming to be from Count
       Geoffery, is really from him, Princess Carisa merely needs to 
       run the text, the signature, and Geoffery's public key (799) through another
       specially crafted mathematical algorithm, and the algorithm is able to
       verify (through the magic of math) that the prime numbers used to generate
       the public key were also
       used to generate the not-so-random signature. If the verification passes,
       Carisa knows that Geoffery's letter is genuine. But if it fails,
       then the Pricess knows that somebody else is trying to impersonate Geoffery.
