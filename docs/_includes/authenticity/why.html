    <p>An ongoing challenge in the art world is that of authenticity
       of provenance, or verifying that a work of art was created by the
       artist it claims to be by, and not a forgery or unauthorized reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>History is full of examples of people discovering that a work of art that
       they paid a small fortune for is, in fact, a forgery and not worth near the
       price paid.</p>

    <p>There are many of ways to attempt to verify the authenticity of a work of
       art, but new technologies are making it easier and easier for forgers to
       create fakes, and it's a virtual arms race for those in the business of
       authenticating art to stay one step ahead.</p>

    <p>I hold no delusions of grandeur that my prints will ever be so
       valued by society that it will ever be worth a forger's time and
       effort to produce &amp; sell copies. Countless artists
       far more talented that I can ever hope to be have never been discovered,
       their lovingly crafted work resold at garage sales to people that
       had no idea the work was an original or even cared who the artist was.</p>
       
    <p>Never-the-less, I find the subject fascinating and can't help but think that
       a little effort up front could potentially make the job a 
       <strong>lot</strong> more difficult for potential forgers and copy-cats.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, as a software engineer by profession with a fascination in
       cryptography, I realized that there were some unique steps I could take to
       protect my art and make it a little more difficult for someone to forge
       copies of my prints.

    <p>There is no procedure or tool to make a piece of art 100% forge proof. Given
       sufficient time, resources, and motivation, a skilled forger can make copies
       of a piece of art that could convince all but the most experienced and
       skilled authenticity experts.</p>

    <p>However, should anybody ever decide to try to make reproductions of any of
       my limited edition prints, or create entirely new prints of photos I never
       took, and slap my name on them to inflate the value, I hope to make the task
       a bit harder for them.
