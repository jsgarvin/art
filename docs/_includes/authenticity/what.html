    <p>Each of my limited edition prints come with several unusual features to
       help complicate attempts at forgery, unauthorized reproductions, and
       outright fakes, and aid in authenticity verification. They are...
       
       <ul>
         <li>A cryptographic signature, in both plain text and encoded as a
           machine readable QR code, on the back of each print which can be
           independently verified by any cryptography expert and even most 
           crypto-hobbyists.</li>
         <li>Details of each print are recorded in a publicly accessible,
           downloadable <a href="https://github.com/jsgarvin/art">online git repository</a>,
           which also includes the source for
           this website. Each update to the repository is also cryptographically
           signed to ensure that I, and only I, made that update.</li>
         <li>A unique acryllic pigment mark next to the serial number on the
             back of each limited edition print, photographed in high resolution
             and recorded for posterity in the above mentioned git repository.</li>
       </ul>
