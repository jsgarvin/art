    <p>Each of my limited edition prints come with a couple unusual features to
       help complicate attempts at forgery, unauthorized reproductions, and
       outright fakes, and aid in authenticity verification. They are...
       
       <ul>
         <li>A cryptographic signature, in both plain text and encoded as a
           machine readable QR code, on the back of each print which can be
           independently verified by any cryptography expert and even most 
           crypto-hobbyists.</li>
         <li>Details of each print are recorded in a publicly accessible,
           downloadable <a href="https://github.com/jsgarvin/art">online git repository</a>,
           which also includes the source for
           this website. Each update to the repository is also cryptographically
           signed to ensure that I, and only I, made that update.</li>
       </ul>
