    <p>Unique details (including a high resolution photo of the pigment mark
       on the back) of each limited edition print are recorded in a publicly
       accessible online git repository to aid in authenticity verification.</p> 

    <p>Each commit to the repository is signed with my public key (see the 
       section on cryptographic signatures).<p>

    <p>I currently maintain the repository on github, but on the off chance
       that any of my prints outlast both myself and github, anybody familiar
       with git (primarily software engineers like myself) can clone the
       repository to their local machine right now and even upload it to
       another git hosting service for long term safe keeping.</p>

    <p>Since each commit is signed with my public key, anybody sufficiently
       familiar with git and cryptography will be able to verify that the
       details on each print were submitted by me, and not by someone that
       cloned and then modified the commit history. </p>
