    <p>Hi!  I'm Jon Garvin: Photographer, Nature Lover, Software Engineer, and
       Beekeeper, not necessarily in that order, and this is my (still under
       construction) photography website.<p>

     <p>I was born, raised and currently live (with my wonderful wife) in
       beautiful Missoula, Montana. We have some backyard beehives that we try
       to keep happy and maybe one of these years they'll reward us with their
       sweet ambrosia.</p>

    <p>I'm particularly interested in macro photography, the kind of extreme
       closeups that reveal hidden details of both the natural and man made worlds
       that are invisible to the naked eye.</p>

    <p>By day I work as a software engineer, currently on an application used by
       anesthesiologists during surgery in many hospitals across the country to
       track anesthetic drugs given to patients, chart vital signs, and more. If
       you've had surgery recently, your anesthesiologist may have been using
       software that I help build and maintain.</p>

    <p>I'm also fascinated by cryptography, the process of converting a message
       into indecipherable text to protect it's contents from anyone that might
       intercept it, and then converting it back to readable form only when it
       successfully reaches it's intended recipient.</p>

    <p>On this site, you can learn more about how I've attempted to combine some
       of these varied interests into art to hang on walls. In particular, be sure
       to check out the <a href="authenticity">authenticity protection</a> pages
       for some fascinating reading that's sure to put you to sleep.
